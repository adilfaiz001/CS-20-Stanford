# CS 20: Tensorflow for Deep Learning Research

## Course Description
TensorFlow is a powerful open-source software library for machine learning developed by researchers at Google. 
It has many pre-built functions to ease the task of building different neural networks. TensorFlow allows 
distribution of computation across different computers, as well as multiple CPUs and GPUs within a single machine.
TensorFlow provides a Python API, as well as a less documented C++ API. For this course, we will be using Python.
